# Core Algorithms

Tests and implementations for algorithms commonly used in job interviews. See the full list in the [algorithms.md](algorithms.md) file.

Base repository for the [Core Algorithms](http://jsdev.learnersguild.org/goals/123) goal.

## Specifications

 Artifact produced is a fork of the core-algorithms repo.
 Can run all tests with npm test.
 All tests are passing.
 For each algorithm in the algorithms list, there exists:
 a test file with at least 2 unit tests using valid inputs, and at least 1 unit test using invalid inputs.
 an implementation file with a correct implementation of the algorithm.

## Required
 The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the MIT license.
 Stretch

 Pick a different programming language from JavaScript (e.g. Ruby, Swift, Python, C, Javaâ€¦) and write tests & implementations for each.

 Can run all non-JavaScript tests with a single command.
 For each algorithm identified above, there exists:
 a test file with multiple unit tests for each algorithm in a language other than JavaScript.
 an implementation file with a correct implementation of the algorithm in a language other than JavaScript.

## Quality Rubric

### Well formatted code
- [ ] Code uses a linter, which can be invoked with a command (e.g. npm run lint). [50 points]
- [ ] Running the linter on all source code files generates no linting errors. [50 points]

### Clear and useful README
- [x] Repository includes a README file with installation and setup instructions. [25 points]
- [x] Repository includes a README file with usage instructions and at least one example use case. [25 points]
- [x] Proper dependency management
- [x] There is a command to install dependencies (e.g. npm install) and it is specified in the installation and         setup instructions of the README. [50 points]

### Good project management
- [x] Commit messages are concise and descriptive. [25 points]
- [x] All features are added via pull requests. [25 points]
- [x] Every pull request has a description summarizing the changes made. [25 points]
- [ ] Every pull request has been reviewed by at least one other person. [25 points]

## Installation and Setup
